<p align="justify"> This work compares and visualizes the crime data for four different cities in the USA, namely Chicago, Baltimore, Dallas, and Denton. We assess areas that are significantly affected based on zip codes and variations in crime categories. As the crime rates have significantly changed both upward and downward throughout time, these changes are compared to their external causes such as population, unemployment, and poverty. The results show crime frequency and distribution across four different cities and supply valuable information about the complex relationship between social factors and criminal behavior. These results and outcomes will help the police department and law enforcement organizations better understand crime issues, map crime incidents onto a geographical map, and supply insight into factors affecting crime that will help them deploy resources and help in their decision-making process.</p>

                  <p>Data preprocessing has been conducted based on the information gathered from city websites to obtain the necessary properties, including Year, Crime Type, and City. To comprehend the increase in crime based on time series, a comparison is made between 4 different cities as well as the analysis of the data is done through Tableau.</p>

                  <p>Fig. 1 the year 2020, Chicago has the highest crime rate with a record of 212141 cases whereas Denton has the lowest crime recorded with just 10532 cases. In the year 2021, Chicago has the lowest crime rate with a record of 208652 cases comparatively little less in 2020, whereas Denton, Baltimore, and Dallas have an increased crime rate compared with 2020. In the year 2022, Chicago and Dallas have the highest number of crime cases 238567 and 138875 recorded when compared with 2021 and 2020 whereas Denton and Baltimore had a slight increase in crime when compared with 2021 and 2020. In the year 2023 by Q2, Chicago&rsquo;s crime rate is soaring high, and Dallas, Denton, and Baltimore have the crime rates recorded as 45744,5269 and 18696.</p>

                  <p>The Safest places to live is determined based on the amount of crime committed or recorded by different sources like City Police Department and FBI. Below analysis is done on four different cities based on their demographics. As per the current data available in different city websites Denton data have the masked address where geo-coding has been applied on the API and identified their latitude and longitude with the Zip codes. Whereas Dallas data have all the attributes like latitude, longitude, and zip code for geo-mapping analysis. Furthermore, Chicago and Baltimore data just have latitude and longitude, and reverse geo-coding has been applied on the API to retrieve zip codes. Below&nbsp;is&nbsp;the flow charts for geo-coding and reverse geo-coding&nbsp;</p>
