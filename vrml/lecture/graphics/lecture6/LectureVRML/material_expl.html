<b><font size=+1>VRML Illustration: Reflection Properties - Material Node</font></b>
<p><hr>

<p>
 The VRML Material node defines material properties of an object that determine the object's reflection characteristics, i.e., the way light reflects off the object. There are six fields in the Material node with a total of 12 parameter values.

This VRML application illustrates the effect of the various fields in the Material node (except for <i>transparency</i>).

<p>
<b>Objects</b>
<p>
The scene shows five objects that rotate about an inclined axis. The <b>yellow button</b> switches the objects from default spheres to high-resolution spheres to rotating cubes.

<p>
<b>Light Source</b>
<p>
The headlight is turned off and replaced by a DirectionalLight node with the field <i>ambientIntensity</i> set to 0.6 (not to be confused with the field <i>ambientIntensity</i> in the Material node). When turning the scene around, the light source moves with the objects.
<p>
Note that all VRML light sources (headlight, DirectionalLight, PointLight, SpotLight) have a default value of 0 for the field <i>ambientIntensity</i> and, therefore, do not place any ambient light in the scene. To study the effect of <i>ambientIntensity</i> in the Material node, a light source must be defined that adds ambient light to the scene.


<p>
<b>Object labeled 'diffuse':</b><br>
<ul>
For the object in the upper left, only <i>diffuseColor</i> is specified (full red), all other material properties are set to zero. The object shows the typical diffuse reflection of a dull surface. The reflected intensity changes with the direction of the surface normals relative to the incoming light direction (Lambert's law). The resultant shading provides the primary information for perceiving the object's shape.
<p>
When turning the scene around, the object is black since the rear part receives no direct light and the object does not reflect ambient light.
</ul>


<b>Object labeled 'diffuse & ambient':</b><br>
<ul>
As with the previous object, <i>diffuseColor</i> is specified (full red). In addition, the field <i>ambientIntensity</i> is set to 0.8 in the Material node. All other parameters are set to zero.
<p>
Turning the scene around shows the ambient reflection on the rear side. Note that ambient reflection is "non-directional", i.e., independent from surface normal directions. This results in a flat appearance of the rear side. This flattening effect of ambient reflection also propagates to the front side and partially overrides the shading from diffuse reflection. A high degree of ambient reflection (as in this example) makes an object look "overexposed".
<p>
The slider on the upper right allows for changing the field <i>ambientIntensity</i> in the Material node between 0 and 1.
<p>
The ambient reflection (or ambient color) of an object is calculated by multiplying <i>ambientIntensity</i> with <i>diffuseColor</i>. Therefore, the effect of ambient reflection can only be seen in combination with a non-zero diffuse color in the Material node. In addition (and as mentioned before), a light source must be present that places ambient light in the scene.
</ul>

<b>Object labeled 'specular':</b><br>
<ul>
Only the fields <i>specularColor</i> (full green) and <i>shininess</i> are specified, all other material properties are set to zero. The resulting specular reflection (or highlight) can only be seen from directions close to the "mirror" direction. The rest of the object is black (no other reflections are specified for this object).
<p>
The field <i>shininess</i> controls the falloff in reflected light intensity from the mirror direction. The initial value of 0.2 can be modified using the slider on the lower left. Note that values below 0.2 create the best effect, values above 0.2 require a highly tessellated surface.
<p>
Specular reflection simulates shiny surfaces and is normally used in connection with diffuse reflection. A high value for <i>shininess</i> simulates a highly polished surface.
</ul>


<b>Object labeled 'emissive':</b><br>
<ul>
Only <i>emissiveColor</i> is specified (full blue), all other material properties are set to zero. As with ambient reflection, emissive reflection is "non-directional" and the object looks flat from all directions.
<p>
Emissive reflection simulates a "glowing" object and does not require a light source.
</ul>


<b>Object labeled "all combined":</b><br>
<ul>
The object in the center combines the material properties from all four objects and includes the effect of the two sliders.
<p>
To obtain a desirable appearance of an object requires a thoughtful combination of the various material properties. Just "adding up" all possible effects (as in this example) will produce very artificial-looking reflection results.
