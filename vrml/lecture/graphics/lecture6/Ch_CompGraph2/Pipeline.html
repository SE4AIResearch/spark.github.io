  <BR>
  A multi-step process is used to convert the view of a 3D model into a 2D pixel 
  representation in the bitmap from where it is displayed on a physical output 
  device.<BR>
  <BR>
  Although called a 'pipeline' process (suggesting sequential steps), step execution 
  is in part sequential, in part parallel, and differs widely among viewing software 
  packages and hardware configurations.<BR>
  <BR>
  High-end graphics computers support this process through special hardware architecture 
  (geometry engine, graphics pipe).<BR>
