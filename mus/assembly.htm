<p>The viewpoint inside the assembly room is animated to provide enhanced view 

  during the assembly of the car. This application can also be used to educate 

  and increase awareness of the progress of manufacturing in a class room setting. 

</p>

<p>Also the assembly room has far consequences than education purposes. It can 

  be used for commercial purposes also. For example the customers can enter the 

  car manufacturing website and virtually assemble their own car just as one can 

  go and assemble their own computer at www.dell.com. <br>

  Showing the basic steps of assembly of a car. </p>

<p>The user is provided with 2 images of the car that he can assembly. The user 

  can also dynamically choose the tyre, CD player, Base, etc.of his choice from 

  the selection panel.</p>

<p>One of the issue that arose was keeping the control panel fixed when we rotate 

  the car in the assembly room. In spite of knowing how to make the control panel 

  still while moving other objects through the lecture notes in the class. We 

  had a tough time trying to implement it in our file. We made a small file and 

  implemented it success fully but when we tried incorporating the same code in 

  our assembly room it behaved differently.</p>

  Used</font></b></font> </div>

<p><font color="#FF0000">1.</font> Pentium IV, windows XP, 523MB RAM, IE explorer 

  as the platform<br>

  <font color="#FF0000">2.</font> 3D MAX for modelling<br>

  <font color="#FF0000">3.</font> Cosmo player<br>

  <font color="#FF0000">4.</font> VRML pad for scripting<br>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="+1">Recomendations for further improvements</font></p>

<p>Future applications of this project will include the development of a this 

  project as a full time game with point systems where points can be gained inside 

  the atrium and in individual museum rooms. The user will be allowed to enter 

  the game room only when he has gained enough points from previous museum rooms. 

  The <font color="#FFFFFF">assembly room</font> will incorporate more options 

  for choosing different cars.</p>
