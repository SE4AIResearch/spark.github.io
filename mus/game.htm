  In this room we have tried to make the car to be interactive and we had also 

  made the car to move around in a track .We attached an animated view point inside 

  the car so that the user could have the view of the driver .We had also put 

  the bumps on the road so that its more realistic .In this room we had given 

  options as how a drunken driver drives and how a sober person drives .</p>

<p>Future applications of this project will include the development of a this 

  project as a full time game room where the user could interact with the car 

  and choose his path rather than the path defined .He could also change gear 

  ,increase speed reverse the car .</p>

  it more interactive as it was intended .We had problems in creating the bumps 

  in the ride.</p>
