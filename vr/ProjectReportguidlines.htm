<ol>

  <li>Submit Project Report at Canvas and bring a hardcopy in the class.</li>

  <li>Format 

    <p>- Give Project Title, Names of group members, Course title, Course number, Faculty.</p>

    <p>- <strong>Abstract</strong> section: Need of the work, why this project is important? What does this VR environment show? Who will be using the VR Application (Target audience)? What were you intending to do? Why are you doing it? Why is this application usefull? </p>

    <p>- <strong>Introduction</strong> section: Goals and Objectives of the project,  The report should describe the designed environment . The different aspects of your environment, etc.  (Include images with figure number and title)</p>
  - <strong>Implementation</strong> section- Describe each functionality with text and images. (add Print screens for important details implemented, Include images with figure number and title)
<p>- <strong>Acknowledgement</strong> Section: material copied from other sites. clearly mark links that point to other sites.</p>
    
    <p>- <strong>References</strong> section: major tools: text, images, Vizard, Unity 3D, VRML 2.0, QuickTime VR, or MPEG video</p>
  </li>

  <li> <strong>GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</strong>: List out the goals of the project. [For example evacuation 

    behavior simulation, plane take-off simulation, hazardous events, reconstruction 

    or remodeling of a building, etc.] <br>

    MODELING: Describe the envisioned virtual environment (building, trees, people, 

    furniture, landscaping elements, etc.)<br>

    o Planned geometry, use of textures, animations, behavior and functionality, 

    etc.<br>

    o Describe how the application will be used. (envisioned users, navigation, interactions, etc.)<br>
        o Explain the modeling done in 3ds Max or google sketchup<br>

  PROGRAMMING: Explain how you used python programming (Vizard) or C#/java programming (Unity 3D) [use print screen image]</li>

  <li><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

     normal'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'> Functionality: Explain how the   following were implemented: (add print screen images to explain each)</span></b>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><strong>Vision</strong>: Use of textures       and 3D models to provide detailed information in the project.</li>
      <li><strong>Sound</strong>: Use speech, music       or ambient sounds to help provide information about this place.</li>
      <li><strong>Animation</strong>: Use at least       three animated object in the project.</li>
      <li><strong>Interactivity</strong>: Use at       least five user-triggered events in the project.</li>
      <li><strong>Characters/Avatars</strong>:  Have animated agents (path following behavior) in the environment. (with key board interactivity)</li>
      <li><strong>Sensors</strong>:  Use at least three different types of sensors (Proximity, Time, Touch, etc.) in the project. </li>
      <li><strong>Player</strong>:  Add a Player Controller to the Scene: First Person Controller or 3rd Person  Controller</li>
      <li><strong>AI Implementation:</strong> AI functionality depending upon the project (navigation, behaviors, shortest  path, etc.), implement different behaviors (selfish, altruistic, learning,  adaptive, etc.) in the environment through a user menu (number of agent&rsquo;s  assignment).</li>
      <li><strong>Interface elements</strong>:  Design the interface that include menu items such as buttons, etc.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Explain  <span class="MsoNormal">the behaviors implemented for different agents/avatars </span>(By including screen shots)</li>
  <li><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:

     &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Argue briefly <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>why

     this application is useful</b> and <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>why

     virtual reality is the appropriate technology</b> for this project.
     <o:p></o:p>
  </span></li>
  <li> Explain problems encountered and remaining shortcomings (Future Work)?  </li>
  <li>Cover the following<br>
    
    geometry, textures, animations, functionality, etc.<br>
    
    how the application can be used (user's manual)?<br>
    
    why is this a useful application?<br>
    
    why is virtual reality the appropriate technology?<br>
    
    problems encountered?<br>
    
    remaining shortcomings?<br>
    
    recommendations for further improvements?<br>
    
  software and hardware used </li>
  <li>Screen Shots :<br>
    
    Add sceen shots for important key places in your environment</li>
</ol>
