                    of a Bowie State University library building in a virtual 
                    environment. The development of virtual reality environment

                    paths that an agent would observe during navigation and evacuation. 
                    This environment can be used via the web or through a physical 
                    kiosk placed at the entrance of the building. This application 
                    can also be used to simulate the evacuation behavior inside

                    of historical sites is one of the main domains in which VR 
                    has been applied extensively for two main reasons. First, 
                    what remained from many of these sites is nothing but a tour 
                    site with many years of landscape changes. The only way to 
                    provide the visitors with views of how the site would look 
                    like during 1815 is to recreate scenes from different perspectives 
                    and locations of the real site. Secondly, by providing VR 
                    tours of a remote site, one can access and view the historical 
                    place using his own computer while staying home and without 
                    even spending a penny.</div></td>
