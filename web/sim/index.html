<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This research work 
  is motivated by the need of research in real-time agent navigation for reaching 
  a goal in emergency situations like evacuation. Unfortunately, little attention 
  is given to topic of human navigation as compared to robot navigation. The proposed 
  human behavior system integrates both artificial intelligence and fuzzy logic 
  parameters. Fuzzy logic is used in refining human emotional behavior by including 
  fuzzy behavioral characteristics such as stress, panic, smoke and anger. The 
  work also proposes a fuzzy and neuro fuzzy application for predicting the probability 
  of an agent to reach its destination when fuzzy behavior characteristics like 
  stress, panic are involved. The work extends the application to simulate battlefield 
  scenario and airplane evacuation scenario. </font></p>
<p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This research study 
  investigates modeling strategies to <em>simulate human egress behavior in emergency 
  scenarios</em> and represent them in a <em>goal-finding computer application</em>. 
  Engineers and planners have to often make decisions regarding how design will 
  affect the behavior of occupants. One way of addressing this problem is to develop 
  a tool that can analyze and relate the behavior of people to design parameters. 
  The question that arises is - to what extent could this simulation model of 
  pedestrian movement accurately support design decision-making? </font> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fuzzy logic is structured 
  that approximates a function through linguistics input/output associations. 
  Fuzzy behaviour in AvatarSim model includes the following three behaviour patterns 
  which cannot be quantified numerically for agents:-</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font color="#ff9933">1.

  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The research work also involves 
  the design of a collision-avoidance algorithm that realistically models the 
  behavior of people using the choice of exit (favorite goal) and sub goals (intermediate 
  goals). Sub goals are placed at each end or intersection of a line in the simulation 
  environment. The distance the sub goal is placed from the end of line is a variable, 
  &#8220;<em>sub goal radius</em>&#8221; that can be set in the input file. A 
  path algorithm is used to navigate around obstacles using a sub goal method.

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The AvatarSim model 
  considers both detouring and speed modifications in the avoidance patterns. 
  Sub-goal system is developed to allow people to effectively navigate around 
  obstacles. The system introduces the notion of <em>agent hierarchy</em> and 
  <em>inter-agent behavior relationship</em> and thus allows a group of agents 
  to be dynamically assembled into a single movable mass. It provides a powerful 
  method to construct a <em>distributed application</em>. Refining of the simulation 
  is done by incorporating fuzzy parameters for agents.</font></p>

  Hall at Wayne State University Scenario</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A lecture hall at 
  Wayne State University was considered where 50 students were used for the study. 
  The students in the study were questioned for various fuzzy variables like: 
  stress, panic, anger, visibility before the evacuation drill was performed. 
  As the evacuation drill was performed on the day of final project presentation 
  for an engineering class, therefore stress level was visibly high. As a result, 
  more comprehensive data set was obtained for the human emotional behavior parameters. 
  This data was incorporated in the AvatarSim for simulation. Fig. 5 represents 
  the corresponding simulation in AvatarSim model.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In contrast to evacuation 
  exercise a simulation allows to do as many simulations as one wants. Thus, the 
  statistical properties in distribution of egress time can be investigated. For 
  this study the data from the real-time evacuation drill was compared to the 
  AvatarSim simulation results. The results from the evacuation drill experiment 
  showed a mark difference in the time for the route to exit 2 where the queue 
  occurred in both simulation and exercise. Also the difference between simulation 
  and exercise was found to be very small and flow rate was constant in both the 
  cases. The behavioral characteristics of an agent such as speed, wait time, 
  stress, panic, preference of goal can be adjusted to simulate a real time scenario. 
  It is believed that once the behavioral parameters of an agent are adjusted 
  for one scenario to depict a person, the same behavior can be transported into 
  a new scenario. The future work will involve studies of training an agent to 
  represent a person&#8217;s behavioral characteristics and performing multiple 
  exercises in multiple scenarios.</font></p>
