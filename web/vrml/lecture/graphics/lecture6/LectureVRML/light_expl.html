<b><font size=+1>VRML Illustration: Light Sources in VRML</font></b>
<p><hr>
 

<br>
This VRML application illustrates the three light source types available through the VRML nodes DirectionalLight, PointLight and SpotLight.<br>
<br>
When loading the application, all lights are off and, therefore, the object cannot be seen initially. Click on the yellow buttons on the left to turn a selected light source on. To see a graphical representation of the light source, click the <b>Show Light Source</b> button.<br>

<ul>
<br><li>
The <b>HEADLIGHT</b> is a directional light connected to the viewer and always pointing in the current viewing direction. The field <i>headlight</i>  in the NavigationInfo node controls the headlight (TRUE/FALSE) with TRUE (headlight on) being the default.<br>

<br><br><li>
The <b>DirectionalLight</b> in this application is identical with the HEADLIGHT for the initial viewpoint. As soon as the viewpoint is changed (e.g., via the <b>Spin</b> button or by rotating the object manually using the mouse), the difference becomes obvious: the directional light is fixed to the object; the HEADLIGHT is fixed to the viewing direction.<br>

<br><br><li>
The <b>PointLight</b> used in this application is located close to the initial viewpoint and, as the directional light, moves with the object.<br>


<br><br><li>
<b>SpotLight 1</b> uses a narrow cone (field <i>beamWidth</i>) inside of which the light is at maximum intensity. Between this narrow cone and the wider cone (field <i>cutOffAngle</i>), light intensity changes from maximum intensity to zero. Use the <b>Show Light Source</b> button to see both cones.<br>


<br><br><li>
For <b>SpotLight 2</b>, both cones are identical, thereby, creating a more pronounced spot light effect. The light source is off-centered and the color is cyan.<br>

</ul>


<br>
Note: For all light sources, the default values for the fields <i>color</i> and <i>intensity</i> are being used (except for the cyan color of SpotLight 2). These default values create a white light at full intensity. For the illuminated object, the default material properties are used (except for the red/green/blue axes).
