<b><font size=+1>VRML Illustration: Smooth Shading controlled by Crease Angle</font></b>
<p><hr>
 

<br>
This VRML application illustrates smooth shading across polygon edges using shared vertex normals. In VRML, this shading option is controlled by the field <i>creaseAngle</i> available in the geometry nodes IndexedFaceSet, ElevationGrid, and Extrusion.<br>
<br>
A crease angle measures the amount by which two connected polygons deviate from laying in the same plane. The field <i>creaseAngle</i> is a tolerance angle (in radians). All edge transitions with a crease angle smaller than or equal to the specified tolerance will be smooth shaded.<br>
<br>

<ul>
<br><li>
In this VRML application, the initial setting for the field <i>creaseAngle</i> is the default value zero resulting in a faceted appearance of the box-shaped polygon mesh and the sphere inside the box. The shading is discontinuous across polygon edges and all faces of the box and the sphere can be clearly distinguished.<br>

<br><br><li>
The tolerance crease angle can be changed from zero to 25, 50, or 75 degrees, respectively. Since the box-shaped object exhibits a variety of crease angles, an increasing number of edges will be smooth shaded as a higher tolerance value is being selected. For the sphere inside the box, all crease angles greater or equal 25 degrees yield the same result.<br>

<br><br><li>
When selecting the highest tolerance  (75 degrees), the relatively sharp edges between the sides and the roof of the box-shaped object are being smooth shaded. The result, however, is not very convincing indicating that smoothing over sharp edges creates an unrealistic appearance.

</ul> 
<br>
Note 1: The comparison of the actual crease angle with the tolerance angle is performed at each vertex. For the two vertices at either side of an edge, the comparison may deliver different results. This yields an edge that is fading out to one side. The effect can be observed by looking at the edges between the polygons of the object's roof.
<br><br>
Note 2: The sphere inside the box is being generated by a script (and not via the VRML Sphere node). The script is included in this VRML file (as Prototype "MySphere") and allows to control the density of the polygon mesh approximating the sphere.
