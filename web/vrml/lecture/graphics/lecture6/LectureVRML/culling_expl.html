<b><font size=+1>VRML Illustration: Back-Face Removal via Culling</font></b>
<p><hr>
 

<br>
<b>To open up the enclosed box:</b><br>
<ul>
- Click on all interactive buttons from left to right: <b>spin</b> -- <b>show normals</b> -- <b>flip normals</b> -- <b> culling</b>
<br><br>
If all buttons are on, the face normals point inside and the culling function is active. The viewer can see inside the box.
</ul>


<br>
<b>To observe culling operation on the closed box:</b><br>
<ul>
- Click the button <b>flip normals</b> again to make the normals point towards the outside of the box.
<br><br>
- Move the <b>transparency slider</b> (center) all the way to the right, thereby, removing the lid of the box.
<br><br>
If culling is still active, the otherwise invisible effect of back-face removal becomes clearly visible. For the initial Viewpoint (Top View), more than 50% of the 12 faces of the box are continuously being removed.
</ul>


<br>
<b>Others:</b><br>
<br>
<ul>
Explore the effect of culling or not-culling by moving to different pre-defined Viewpoints (Front View, Inside View) and by switching normal directions and culling function.<br>
<br>
The small button on the right of the slider controls the display of a wire frame outline of the box.<br>
<br>
Note: If culling is not active, the normal directions have no effect.
</ul>

<b>Implementation:</b><br>
<br>
<ul>
This VRML demonstration uses the IndexedFaceSet node to represent the box. The vertices of all faces are specified in counterclockwise order if seen from the outside. By default, the front-faces are seen from the outside and the resulting normals point towards the outside of the box.<br>
<br>
The field <i>ccw</i> (= counterclockwise, default value TRUE) can be used to change the default order to clockwise (set <i> ccw</i> to FALSE) and, thereby, flip all normals in the opposite direction. If <i>ccw</i> is FALSE, the back-faces are seen from the outside.<br>
<br>
Culling is controlled using the field <i>solid</i>. The default value TRUE assumes a solid object that can only be seen from the outside. The default setting (TRUE) activates culling and removes polygons that face away from the viewer. Setting <i>solid</i> to FALSE deactivates culling and renders the front-faces as well as the back-faces of all polygons.
