<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><b><font size="+1">Origin of the idea</font></b></font></p>

<p>The VRML Museum Project is part of the ERC/RMS Museum Project at University 

  of Michigan.The VRML project was conceived with the interest of informing the 

  public about the evolution of current manufacturing systems. The primary objective 

  of this project is to create a museum exhibit that will educate and increase 

  awareness of the progress of manufacturing.&nbsp; The project&#146;s goals are 

  to educate participants about manufacturing, expose them to the computer/technology 

  advancements that have occurred.</p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><font size="+1" color="#FF0000"><b>How the application can be 

  used?</b></font></p>

<p>The VRML Museum project is developed for display at <a href="http://www.aahom.org/">Ann 

  Arbor hands on Museum</a>.</p>

<p>This application can also be used to educate and increase awareness of the 

  progress of manufacturing in a class room setting. </p>

<p>Also the assembly room has far consequences than education purposes. It can 

  be used for commercial purposes also. For example the customers can enter the 

  car manufacturing website and virtually assemble their own car just as one can 

  go and assemble their own computer at www.dell.com.</p>

  <font color="#FF0000">4.</font> The user can explore areas that are normally 

  off limits to the casual visitor.<br>

  <font color="#FF0000">5.</font> To provide visual representations and to facilitate 

  better understanding of manufacturing processes in class room setting. <br>

<p><font color="#00FFFF">&middot; Planned geometry:</font></p>

<p>To give a user a real time experience of entering a museum we have tried to 

  model the entrance of our museum similar to High Museum of Art, Atlanta, Georgia.Our 

  museum is modeled such that the front entrance gives the feeling of entering 

  a real museum. The Museum Building has the landscaping elements like trees, 

  people etc. </p>

<p align="left"><br>

  <font color="#00FFFF">&middot; Use of textures: </font></p>

<p>We have texture mapped the building according to our need and created our own 

  interior spaces like atrium, individual museum rooms, doors, reception area 

  etc. Also the texture maps on the car, the museum doors and windows, individaul 

  components of the car such as tyres, rim, CD player, etc. in the assembly room. 

  Imaging room has a series of walls all lined with pictures which are basically 

  textures. </p>

  VRML Museum </a></p>

<p align="left">We planned how we intended to connect the different museum rooms, 

  and provide a logical transition from one file to the next. At the entrance 

  there is a reception desk that has buttons. By clicking the buttons the doors 

  of the museum and the text displaying the name of the museum lights up. One 

  can now click the doors and enter the museum.</p>

  <font color="#00FFFF">&middot; Animations: </font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Production Room:</font> The lathe machine has sensors 

  through which the animation of the lathe machine takes place. Also there is 

  animation on the robot performing welding of the car in the production line.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Assembly room:</font> The viewpoint inside the assembly 

  room is animated to provide enhanced view during the assembly of the car.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Game Room:</font> The car is animated from the driver's 

  viewpoint. We have tried to animate the car which is driven by a drunken person 

  and when a clear-headed person is driving.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="+1"><b>Problems Encountered</b></font></p>

<p><br>

  Because, the complexity of our Museum would have totaled to too many polygons 

  in a single VRML file, it was necessary to divide our world into separate files 

  that are interlinked. Although this problem was overcome, we planned carefully 

  how to connect the different museum rooms, and provide a logical transition 

  from one file to the next. Thus, we have developed all the individual rooms 

  in separate files and then in lined them together with the museum file.</p>

<p>Another issue that arose was keeping the control panel fixed when we rotate 

  the car in the assembly room. In spite of knowing how to make the control panel 

  still while moving other objects through the lecture notes in the class. We 

  had a tough time trying to implement it in our file. We made a small file and 

  implemented it success fully but when we tried incorporating the same code in 

  our assembly room it behaved differently.</p>

<p>Another issue that arose was that the modeling of both the lathe and welding 

  machine had to be broken down into separate objects so that they could be animated 

  as intended. To make the animation more realistic and smooth we had to spend 

  a major part of our time.<br>

</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="+1">Recomendations for further improvements</font></p>

<p>Future applications of this project will include the development of a this 

  project as a full time game with point systems where points can be gained inside 

  the atrium and in individual museum rooms. The user will be allowed to enter 

  the game room only when he has gained enough points from previous museum rooms.</p>

<p>The <font color="#00FFFF">Production room</font> will incorporate more machines 

  for showing the production line.</p>

<p>The <font color="#00FFFF">Assembly room</font> will incorporate more options 

  for choosing different cars.</p>

<p>The <font color="#00FFFF">Imaging room</font> will incorporate informative 

  exhibition about historical and technical background with game quiz concept.</p>

<p>The <font color="#00FFFF">Game room</font> can have more interactivity to the 

  manufactured car like changing gears, opening the door, playing the CD player 

  .etc.<br>
