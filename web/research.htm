<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The project incorporates 
  development of AvatarSim model that is developed using theoretical background 
  in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Fuzzy Logic techniques to model an individual&#8217;s 
  behavior as well as group behavior in emergency situations. Experience shows 
  that human behavior is unpredictable when it comes to making decisions in emergencies. 
  This unpredictability is due to human emotional behavior. Human characteristics 
  such as stress, panic, and anger could contribute to a different result than 
  in a calm and panic situation. Fuzzy logic is used to represent the degree of 
  factors such as stress, panic, and anger. The model AvatarSim is developed in 
  Java programming language and can be displayed on a web browser. Future work 
  includes development of self learning adaptive behavior for intelligent agents 
  and development of fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy approach for uncertainty modeling. 
  Also, evaluation of VRML approach for simulation and modeling of agent based 
  human behavior system.</font></p>

  area include Simulating and Modeling of Bowie State University's Library for 
  Navigation, Educational Virtual Learning Environment/ Virtual Professor's Classroom, 
  Battlefield Scenario Simulation, and Evacuation Simulations. The development 
  of virtual reality environment makes it possible for a user to understand and 
  observe multiple paths that an agent would observe during navigation and evacuation.

  The sensor network research will also focus on efficient video/image data delivery 
  and real-time visual surveillance. The hardware involves a mobile base station 
  mounted on a robot, video cameras, and various sensors. The network prototypes 
  and data access schemes can be simulated in NS2 simulators.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Virtual Reality (VR) 
  is widely acknowledged as an environment with a great potential for learning 
  and teaching. The ability of Virtual Reality to explain the principles of design, 
  manufacturing and business far surpasses that of books. Virtual environments 
  (VE) provide facility for experiential learning by allowing the students to 
  explore the VE at their own pace and interact in real time. Game creation can 
  be used as a metaphor in creating and using learning resources for early design 
  education. The metaphors related to play could be games, explorations, intrinsic 
  rewards; and rules and how they can be used in learning games. Students enjoy 
  working with virtual worlds and this experience can be highly motivating. Web-based 
  environment provides a non-immersive virtual reality experience. Thousands of 
  VRML worlds are already available on the Web and the number is increasing daily.
