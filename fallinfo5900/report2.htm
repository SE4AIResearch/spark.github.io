        The report must contain the following sections:</p>

      <p align="left"> 1. Cover Page and Individual Contributions Breakdown.<br>

        2. Table of Contents<br>

        <br>

        3. Summary of Changes<br>

        Provide an itemized list of key revisions (e.g., interaction diagrams, 

        class and package diagrams).<br>

        4. Customer Statement of Requirements (as in Report 1, revised if required 

        )<br>

        5. Glossary of Terms (as in Report 1, revised if required )<br>

        6. Functional Requirements Specification (as in Report 1, revised if required 

        )<br>

        Elaborate only the use cases that will be implemented by the time of the 

        final demo.<br>

        System Sequence Diagrams to incorporate the use cases that will be completed 

        for the final demo.<br>

        7. Nonfunctional Requirements (as in Report 1,revised if required )<br>

        <br>

        8. Domain Analysis (as in Report 1, revised if required )<br>

        9. Interaction Diagrams <br>

        Your interaction diagrams must include some of the Design Patterns that 

        we covered in the lectures <br>

        Explain and justify the patterns that you use in your new design. State 

        explicitly in what sense the use of the specific design pattern in the 

        particular interaction diagrams improves the design.<br>

        10. Class Diagram and Interface Specification (as in Report 1, revised 

        if required )<br>

        <br>

        11. System Architecture and System Design <br>

        12. Algorithms and Data Structures </p>

    </div>

<blockquote> 

  <div align="left">a. Algorithms<br>

    Describe the system use algorithms used. For example, when computing a motion 

    trajectory for an animate figure in a game, you may use some numerical or 

    computer-graphics algorithms. You can use activity diagrams to describe the 

    algorithm design.<br>

    b . Data Structures<br>

    Describe the data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.</div>

        13. User Interface Design and Implementation<br>

        <br>

        14. Conclusions and Future Work (minimum 2 pages)<br>

        Describe the technical challenges you encountered during your project.<br>

        Describe how the software engineering techniques you learned in this course 

        will help you in addressing these challanges<br>

        Describe what other knowledge you feel might have helped you with the 

        project development<br>

        Discuss future work for your project and if somebody was to improve on 

        your project, what directions and things to look for</p>

      <p align="left"><br>

        <font color="#ff9933">15. References</font><br>

        The list of references should contain references and URLs of any material 

        that is used in the project. Most importatnly if you are using an existing 

        system or concept from any web resource, you must mention this in the 

        starting of the report and also site the reference.</p>
