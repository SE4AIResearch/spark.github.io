  evacuation simulation of a school building using virtual reality. It is well 
  known that crowd stampede is one of the most disastrous forms of collective 
  behavior caused due to panic. It leads to fatalities as people get trampled

  with several classrooms with students, teachers, chairs, televisions, walls, 
  doors and tables.This simulation aims to aid the visitors in navigation within

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Quick evacuation 
  of occupants in a building is very critical to save lives. Training of occupants 
  in a real-time environment is very complex because it is both expensive and 
  dangerous. It is well known that crowd stampede is one of the most disastrous 
  forms of collective behavior that is caused due to panic. It leads to fatalities 
  as people get trampled and crushed as they fall. The evacuation simulation in 
  Virtual Reality demonstrates how people behave in emergency scenarios which 
  they may not be able to experience in a real world. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many research and 
  social interaction aspects of crowd behavior are beyond the reach of available 
  tools. The VR environment is able to adapt for specific design situations and 
  provide insight to current perspective as well as what-if questions. Our hypothesis 
  is that mutual concern, helping, and co-ordination will more likely occur when 
  crowd members share a common identity. The selfish behavior associated with 
  'mass panic' may occur in evacuation if there is no shared identity. Our hypothesis 
  is that the visualization studies support the conclusion that, where there is 
  a strong sense of collective identity, there will be mutual concern and helping.
