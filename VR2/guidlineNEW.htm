<ol>
  <li>Submit Project Report at blackboard and bring a hardcopy in the class.</li>
  <li>Format 
    <p>- give project title, faculty </p>
    <p>- reduce image size </p>
    <p>- acknowledge material copied from other sites</p>
    <p>- clearly mark links that point to other sites</p>
    <p>- major tools: text, images, VRML 2.0, QuickTime VR, or MPEG video</p>
  </li>
  <li> GOAL AND OBJECTIVES: List out the goals of the project. [For example evacuation 
    behavior simulation, plane take-off simulation, hazardous events, reconstruction 
  or remodeling of a building, etc.] </li>
  <li>What were you intending to do?<br>
    MODELING: Describe the envisioned virtual environment (building, trees, people, 
    furniture, landscaping elements, etc.)<br>
    o Planned geometry, use of textures, animations, behavior and functionality, 
    etc.<br>
    o Describe how the application will be used.<br>
    (envisioned users, navigation, interactions, etc.)<br>
  </li>
  <li>The students will be exposed to the process of modeling and  scripting the virtual environment, by developing a complete VR application. The  project must include:
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Vision: Use of textures       and 3D models to provide detailed information in the project.</li>
      <li>Sound: Use speech, music       or ambient sounds to help provide information about this place.</li>
      <li>Animation: Use at least       three animated object in the project.</li>
      <li>Interactivity: Use at       least three user-triggered events in the project.</li>
      <li>Sensors: Use at least       three different types of sensors (Cylinder, Plane, Proximity, Sphere,       Time, Touch, and Visibility).in the project.</li>
      <li>Multi-user Environment:       More than two people to be present in the same environment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Content 
    <p>- The report should describe the designed environment . The different aspects of you environment, etc. </p>
    <p>- more details about the implementation. (add Print screens where required) </p>
  </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Explain the behaviors implemented in Vizard for different agents/avatars </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Explain the multi-user capability implmented. Also, mention about why different users should be present in yoiur environment and their significance. </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Mention the AI functionality implemented for agents. </li>
  <li>Cover the following geometry, textures, animations, functionality, etc.<br>
    how the application can be used (user's manual)?<br>
    why is this a useful application?<br>
    why is virtual reality the appropriate technology?<br>
    problems encountered?<br>
    remaining shortcomings?<br>
    recommendations for further improvements?<br>
  software and hardware used</li>
  <li>Minimum:<br>
    text describing the figures<br>
  still images (figures) of VRML 2.0 model (Print screens), Also describe what each figure is showing in the report.(For e.g: Fig. 2 shows the museum room where...
