<ol>

  <li>Submit Project Report at blackboard and bring a hardcopy in the class.</li>

  <li>Format 

    <p>- give project title, names of group members, faculty </p>

    <p>- reduce image size </p>

    <p>- acknowledge material copied from other sites or people advised </p>

    <p>- clearly mark links that point to other sites</p>

    <p>- major tools: text, images, Vizard, Unity 3D</p>

  </li>

  <li> <strong>GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</strong>: List out the goals of the project. [For example evacuation 

    behavior simulation, plane take-off simulation, hazardous events, reconstruction 

    or remodeling of a building, etc.] What were you intending to do? Why are you doing it? Who will use this application? Why is this application usefull? Who is the target audience?<br>

    MODELING: Describe the envisioned virtual environment (building, trees, people, 

    furniture, landscaping elements, etc.), Explain the modeling done in 3ds Max or google sketchup<br>

    o Planned geometry, use of textures, animations, behavior and functionality, 

    etc.<br>

    o Describe how the application will be used. (envisioned users, navigation, interactions, etc.)<br>
        o Explain the <strong><strong>Multi-User Environment</strong> using photon or vizard: create a systems architecure diagram for the multi-user environment. </strong><br>

  o PROGRAMMING: Explain how you used python programming (Vizard) or C#/java programming (Unity 3D) [use print screen image]</li>

  <li><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

     normal'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'> Functionality: Explain how the   following are implemented: (add print screen images to explain each)</span></b>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li class="style1"><strong><strong>Multi-User Environment</strong>:       More than two people to be present in the same environment.</strong></li>
      <li class="style1"><strong>Vision</strong>: Use of textures       and 3D models to provide detailed information in the project.</li>
      <li class="style1"><strong>Sound</strong>: Use speech, music       or ambient sounds to help provide information about this place.</li>
      <li class="style1"><strong>Animation</strong>: Use at least       three animated object in the project.</li>
      <li class="style1"><strong>Interactivity</strong>: Use at       least five user-triggered events in the environment. </li>
      <li class="style1"><strong>Characters</strong>: Have animated agents (path following behavior) in the environment.</li>
      <li class="style1"><strong>Sensors</strong>: Use at least       three different types of sensors ( Proximity, Time, Touch, and Visibility) in the project.</li>
      <li class="style1"><strong>Player</strong>: Add a Player Controller to the Scene: First Person Controller or 3rd Person Controller</li>
      <li class="style1"><span class="MsoNormal"><strong>CUSTOM avatar</strong>: (car/fish, etc.) and atleast 1 INBUILT avatar in vizard/Unity3D to create the multi-agent system.</span></li>
      <li class="style1"><strong>AI</strong>: Implement AI functionality depending upon the project (navigation, behaviors, shortest path, etc.), implement different behviors (selfish, altruistic, learning, adaptive, etc.) in the environment through a user menu (number of agents assignment).</li>
      <li class="style1"><strong>Interface</strong>: Design the interface that include menu items such as buttons, etc.<br>
      </li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>
  Show how the following were added-- add printscreens and description  for each figure in the Virtual Environment. [ Each figure should have a figure number, caption and description] </li>
  <li>Explain  <span class="MsoNormal">the behaviors implemented for different agents/avatars </span></li>
  <li><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:

     &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Argue briefly <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>why

     this application is useful</b> and <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>why

     virtual reality is the appropriate technology</b> for this project.
     <o:p></o:p>
  </span></li>
  <li> Content
    <p>cover the following<br>
      geometry, textures, animations, functionality, etc.<br>
      how the application can be used (user's manual)?<br>
      why is this a useful application?<br>
      why is virtual reality the appropriate technology?<br>
      problems encountered?<br>
      remaining shortcomings?<br>
      recommendations for further improvements?<br>
      software and hardware used
    </p>

<li>Acknowledgement: - acknowledge material copied from other sites or people (adviser)</li>
  <li>Screen Shots :<br>
    
    Add sceen shots for important key places in your environment</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>

  <p>Add text describing the figures<br>

    Also describe what each figure is showing in the report.(For e.g: Fig. 2 shows the museum room where...)</p>
