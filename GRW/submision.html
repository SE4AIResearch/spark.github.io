            <p align="left">All abstract review decisions are  final. Because of the timeline, there is no appeals process or opportunity to  resubmit once an abstract is rejected.</p>
            <p align="left">Once accepted, the conference staff will group  abstracts with similar themes in the conference oral sessions.&nbsp; The presentation session schedule is FINAL and session times cannot be  changed</p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

            <strong>Game Theme  Based Instructional Module for Array and Objects using Virtual Reality</strong></p>

            <p align="left"><em>There is a need to change the  traditional passive method of teaching to an active method of teaching such as  game and simulation-based learning. In the expansion of education reform,  gaming is considered one of the effective tools to teach students. There is  also a need to embody the educational effect of games, for combining games and  learning together. Every upcoming programmers or advance programmers know that  arrays and objects are widely known key programming terms which are keep to  heart. Sometimes, key programming terms are difficult for students to  comprehend who are newly introduced to arrays and objects. Every semester,  countless students seek tutor center help concerning arrays. The authors of the  text-book try to solve these problems by repetitively changing the  illustrational design of the test-book for every edition they produce, which to  no avail isn&rsquo;t enough to simplify the structure of an array.</em></p>
            <p align="left"><em><br>
              The objectives of this research is  to design, develop, and evaluate a game theme based instructional (GTI)  module.&nbsp; The aim is to create Virtual  Reality course educational modules with more inquiry based problem-solving  activities and hand-on experiences. The GTI module is based on a proven  framework for evaluation of game and simulation-based learning. The gaming  instructional module will help students learn about arrays and objects through  the use of trial and error games and demonstrations. Our hypothesis is that the  use of gaming instructional modules will lead to better student learning  outcomes. The GTI modules have adopted the constructive learning approach and  are developed using a gaming metaphor. The design of the GTI modules is modeled  from the revised &lsquo;Bloom's taxonomy.' Furthermore, in this research, we have  incorporated a proven framework with a minor extension for the design and  development of GTI modules. Our proposed instructional module uses a gaming  metaphor in demonstrating the concepts of Multidimensional Arrays and objects.  The proposed GTI module is designed and developed using 3Ds Max and Vizard. </em></p>
            <p align="left"><em><br>
              Students were evaluated in two  phases during the research study. The data were analyzed using statistical  analysis methods. We have applied proven evaluation scale/methodology for the  evaluation of the effectiveness of GTI modules, which includes: (1) Student  Assessment of Learning Gains (SALG) to evaluate the learning gain. (2) Science  Motivation Questionnaire II (SMQII) for evaluating the motivation of students.  (3) User Engagement Scale (UES) for evaluating the usability of GTI modules.  (4) Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) for evaluating the likability of GTI  modules. We have performed the t-test for evaluating learning gain and  motivation of students, ANOVA test for evaluating the likability based on  familiarity with other virtual reality games and, grounded theory for the  evaluation of usability of GTI modules.&nbsp;  The result of evaluation shows that the GTI modules produces better  learning gain and; are usable, likable, motivational, and engaging.</em></p>
