<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There has been increasing research in developing  offline web applications. This project concentrates on developing a new  methodology for the online assessment web applications that could be used while  offline. It is important to retrieve the critical data collected during an  examination without a provision of a backup mechanism. There is a need for an  assessment system that can adapt to work uninterruptedly and without loss of  critical data while there is intermittent internet discontinuity. This project  describes architecture and implementation of online assessment system with  offline capabilities. Online assessment system with offline capabilities will  not interrupt examinee&rsquo;s experience while appearing for an assessment test if  internet connection is not available. A development methodology is designed and  a compliant framework is implemented to enhance online assessment system with  offline capabilities.</font></p>
<p><font color="#ff9933" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2. Description </strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Microsoft .NET technologies and XML standard make a great combination  for implementing distributed information systems. XML enables disparate  software systems to exchange messages. C# enables implementation of distributed  information systems in a methodical way. As C# together with XML provides  several technologies for integration, designers face the challenge of combining  the technologies in the most effective and flexible manner possible to create  an integration architecture that is opt for future extensions and changes. XML  fragments are transferred from server to client, where they are read or  modified, and modifications of client transactions are transferred back to the  server. The clients use XPath expressions to access XML fragments, i.e. all XML  fragments read or written by clients. This reduces the data exchange in  synchronization. We furthermore suggest exchanging XPath expressions instead of  larger XML fragments wherever possible. This allows us not only to treat lost  connections more flexible but also to operate efficiently on clients with small  bandwidth connections to a server<em>.</em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Fig.1 shows the architecture of the online assessment system with  offline capabilities. The system is divided into four major parts - assessment  database server, XML Decoder, Client Application UI, Client XML data storage.</font></p>

Examinee logs into the OAS (Online Assessment System) website by authenticating  himself/herself with the valid credentials. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An online assessment system with offline capabilities shows modeless  characteristic. In a modal application, when the application is online it  communicates with the server. When it's offline, it uses the local storage.  Data must be synchronized when the application switches between modes.&nbsp; Switching between online and offline modes is  done automatically in the background while examinee is appearing for an  assessment test. An online assessment system with offline capabilities uses the  local storage as much as possible and does continuous, small data  synchronization in the background when the server is available. The advantages  of modeless applications are:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A better  user experience. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The user  does not have to be aware of network connectivity or switching states.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The  application work smoothly even with intermittent network connections.</font></li>
