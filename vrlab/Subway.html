                  <p><strong>Current <font size="+1">Students: </font></strong>Phillip Devreaux</p>

                  <p><strong>Past Students: </strong>Pranay Rajeev, Stephon Mackey, Oumar Soumare, Stephen Otunba, Mike Tice, Aaron Boothe, and Titus Thomas </p>

                  <p><em>Status: Current </em></p>

                  <p>People catch the train to get around the city for many reasons, and with so many people using subway trains, emergencies are bound to occur. A virtual multi-user environment can be used to find flaws in evacuation procedure and show passengers a better way to avoid danger in an emergency. Virtual Reality (VR)  training has been used for training and education for many years in military  and medical fields. We have used game creation  as a metaphor in creating an experimental setup to study evacuation behavior in a Subway Environment. The Oculus Rift is a new virtual reality headset that lets players step inside the game and virtual world. The user can be in virtual world if he has a Oculus Rift device connected to his machine and a game designed for Oculus. 

                    The difference is that a player can feel the game in terms of visualization as he will have a 360 degree projection. 

                  Oculus rift helps in real time scenario&rsquo;s considering an emergency occurring in pubic places. Creating a live emergency with real people would be dangerous and unethical. However, creating a virtual emergency with real people is safe and efficient.</p>

                  <p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>

                  <ul>

                    <li>Our hypothesis is that the &ldquo;sense of presence&rdquo; provided by  the multi-user virtual environment will allow running simulations and  conducting evacuation drills without the cost and risk of injury to live actors </li>

The use of collaborative  virtual environments to run virtual evacuation drills for an emergency  evacuation eliminates risk of injury to participants and allows for the testing  of scenarios that could not be tested in real life due to legal issues and  possible health risks to participants. <strong><em>Our contribution lies in our approach to  combine computer simulated agents and user controlled autonomous agents in a  collaborative virtual environment </em></strong>to perform virtual evacuation drills. Results  from this study can be used to measure the effectiveness of current procedures,  protocols, and the effectiveness of training for airline and security personals.</td>
