            <p align="justify">The goal of this project is to develop a team-based data science corps program for undergraduate students from Computer Science, Information Systems, and Business integrating both academic training as well as hands-on experience through real-world data science projects. This project is a collaborative effort with the University of Maryland Baltimore County as the coordinating as well as an implementing organization, and the University of Baltimore, Towson University, and Bowie State University as implementing organizations. This project focuses on the city of Baltimore as an exemplar for other cities in the US and across the globe. The project team will collaborate with a number of communities in the city of Baltimore to integrate real-world data science projects into classroom instruction in data science. The specific objectives of this project are as follows: (i) Develop the technical, analytical, modeling, and critical thinking skills that are key to success as a data science professional; (ii) Connect a cohort of students to communities, organizations, and projects that can benefit from the power of data science; (iii) Nurture and support innovative thinking in solving some of the key challenges facing the real world; (iv) Promote a better understanding of the power and pitfalls of data-driven discoveries to improve the quality of life in urban communities; (v) Increase the data science workforce capacity to support this critical area that is of growing importance in society; and finally, (vi) Evaluate the effect of the proposed data science corps on student learning. </p>
<p align="justify">This project will create a core set of knowledge that will be valuable in developing solutions for real-world urban settings with the understanding that not all projects will require the application or use of every topic covered in the data science corps program. The core set of knowledge includes data collection and cleaning, data analysis using machine learning and deep learning techniques, data visualization including geospatial data and virtual reality, data privacy and security, and infrastructure for smart cities including IoT-based sensor networks. The proposed data science corps program will have two main phases: instructional phase (10 modules in total) and real-world team projects (5 modules in total). The project teams consist of students who have taken a course in at least one of the following areas: data collection and analysis, big data, machine learning including deep learning, smart cities, cybersecurity, geospatial data analysis and visualization, and virtual reality.</p>

It is found that the higher death rate of African Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly influenced by factors such as living in more crowded housing situations, working in consumer-facing serviced industries, having higher rates of existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, asthma, and heart, liver and kidney diseases, lack of insurance or a consistent care source limits access to COVID-19 testing and treatment, and the prison system. </div></td>

However, the VRI/GTI modules should be usable and likable to include it in a class curriculum. We have incorporated a virtual instructor to help the users learn in the modules. We have evaluated the GTI modules using Student Assessment of their Learning Gains (SALG), User Engagement Scale (UES), Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), and Science Motivation Questionnaire (SMQII) to evaluate usability, likability, and motivation respectively. The result of evaluation shows that the modules are usable, likable, motivational, and engaging. </div></td>
