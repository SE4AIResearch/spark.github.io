Vizard is a 3D development platform to build interactive and immersive   3D content. Vizard also supports numerous  devices such as 3D wall,   cave, gloves, haptic   displays, force-feedback systems, gamepads, and   joysticks. Avatars included have built-in human face, body models and an   accompanying morph designer    to  instantly insert virtual humans into     existing environments.We have created a  multi user environment  to   allow participants in different geographical locations to connect and    experience the simulation together. Participants can enter the VR game as a car avatar or human avatar and have the corresponding navigation features. </p>

                <p>Pilot studies have been conducted with the system showing its partial success and demonstrate that collaborative learning approach we propose can succeed with smaller group sizes. A significant number of participants followed the traffic rules. Overall 24% participants did not follow any traffic rule. Interestingly the majority of users who did not follow the traffic rules were novice users. Subjective responses  indicated that the Collaborative virtual environment was realistic and  engaging. This environment will allow users to prepare for driving exams and we  hope that it could possibly become an alternative, supplement, or replacement  for the traditional driver&rsquo;s handbook.</p>
                <h2 align="left">Phase 1: User studies for multi-user evacuation study</h2>
                <p>We have conducted user studies for the Multi-user city evacuation virtual environments.  We conducted 40-50 sessions involving two-four users each session. Users experienced the virtual environment in one of two formats <br>
                  1) <strong>Non-Immersive Environment:</strong> With desktop computer, mouse and keyboard.<br>
                  2) <strong>Immersive Environment</strong>: with a head mounted display and mouse. </p>

                <p>We collected data during the sessions by screen capturing for evaluation. After the session, the student survey for VR environment was also administered. More than 100 respondents participated in this first phase of the user surveys. The majority (74%) of the survey respondents were male. Approximately a quarter were female. The user base for this first phase of the user study can be described as fairly experienced in gaming. The majority (70%) indicated possession of an intermediate to level of gaming experience. Approximately a third of the respondents indicated gaming experience at a novice level.</p>

In future we plan to develop alternate forms of  guidance such as verbal and augmented graphics in the virtual city.  Furthermore, audio communication is planned to be integrated into the system.</p>

                <p align="justify">Virtual reality provides a good way of  visualization of the behaviors produced by these models. We are developing a  crowd behavior capability in a virtual city where there are traffic intersection  junctions for people to cross over the road. We will generate a wide variety of  civilian individual and group behaviors at differing levels of fidelity. In transportation, VR has the potential to model  flows and driving simulations. It leads to observing built and natural  environments from the driver&rsquo;s perspective. Our simulation will consist of  autonomous virtual human agents walking on the side walk in the virtual 3D  environment. Agents will have 3D graphic body representations, which are able to  perform certain low-level actions, such as playing of pre-recorded animation  sequences such as gestures or walking to specified location. Similarly, there  are pre-recorded animation sequences for cars moving on the road in the VR  city.</p></td>
