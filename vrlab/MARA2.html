            <p>Augmented reality (AR) is a technology  that allows people to view the real world augmented by computer-generated  components. A mobile AR application (MARA) was built to assist users to  evacuate the Computer Science Building located at Bowie State University. Live  evacuation drills which seem like an ideal way of training people how to  evacuate a building; however, humans cannot always participate in evacuation  drills since those drills may conflict with their personal schedules. Another  drawback to live evacuation drills is that they may be dangerous to participate  in since they could require participants to encounter hazards. Lastly, live  evacuation drills do not feature the genuine sense of urgency as real  emergencies meaning that live evacuation drills may not be effective at  training people to evacuate. Virtual evacuation drills train people to evacuate  a building without them having to be present at a live evacuation drill and  encounter the danger that they may present. Thus, the MARA was built as an  alternative to live evacuation drills using Unity3d along with the Vuforia AR  Toolkit and the Android SDK. The uniqueness of this research effort is the  inclusion of visual cues, known as intelligent signs, to further assist the user in  evacuating the building. Although, the app has been tested out throughout its  development, a user study will be performed to evaluate its usability and the  effectiveness of the intelligent signs.</p>

                    <li>Blue  Arrows: On each floor, there are blue arrows placed on the floor.&nbsp; The purpose for the arrows are to indicate  the paths towards each exit.&nbsp; </li>
