The uniqueness of this research effort is the inclusion of visual cues, known as intelligent signs, to further assist the user in evacuating the building.

                    insight to current perspective as well as what-if questions. 

                    Our hypothesis is that mutual concern, helping, and co-ordination 

                    will more likely occur when crowd members share a common identity. 

                    The selfish behavior associated with 'mass panic' may occur 

                    in evacuation if there is no shared identity. Our hypothesis 

                    is that the visualization studies support the conclusion that, 

                    where there is a strong sense of collective identity, there 

                    will be mutual concern and helping. </p></td>
