            <p align="justify">Over the past decade wildfires have been making  headlines. As a result, wildland firefighting has grown to a high level of  importance. The US is in dire need of an effective strategy to address this  issue. The  goal of this project is to create a helicopter training simulation that will  aid in the efforts of treating wildfires. The simulation includes various  scenarios immolating real-world instances. Real-world instances are in place to  develop alternative techniques that may be applied to real life situations. It  is anticipated that the user will gain skills and knowledge in the virtual  environment that they will then be able to apply to the real world due to the  sense of presence and realism a virtual environment can provide. This  application has a dual purpose. The simulation may be used for both training  and educational purposes. The application will track user efficiency and  decision making strategies. Multiple agents are necessary for this environment  because it will promote communication, collaboration, and will enhance the decision  making process. The simulation  contains multiple helicopter  agents and multiple victim agents as user controlled agents. The user has keyboard controls to navigate the helicopter.  The    downpour of rain is achieved with a toggle-able visibility.&nbsp; The &ldquo;r&rdquo;   key is used to toggle the downpour of  rain.&nbsp; The &ldquo;z&rdquo; and &ldquo;x&rdquo; key   strokes cause  for the deployment and retraction of the rope   respectively from the helicopter.</p>
            <p align="justify">The simulation uses a helicopter to rescue  victims from a burning city.   The environment includes several agents (avatars)  in need of rescue.   The victims are animated to show realistic emotions such as  panic and   frenzy. The landscape is textured with a cloudy skybox that includes    multiple buildings. The building architecture is a simple rectangular   geometry textured  with brick, glass, steel, and other materials. The   user has total control of  the helicopter and can move in any direction. </p>

Intelligenct signs will be added in the  perspective of the victim. Intelligence signs will guide the user to safety. The  simulation  includes audio for helicopter in flight, low audio for the  avatars, as well as sound effects for the different actions taking place within  the environment. The simulation  also contain multiple user controlled helicopter agents.The server view  displays all of the  agents who are currently using the simulation. </p>
