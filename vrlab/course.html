                  <p align="justify">The goal of this project is to create course curriculum modules for computer science and mathematics students.   Engineering and Mathematic courses are typically  considered as   difficult by college students and exhibit high failure rate. Due  to the   complication and abstract nature of computer hardware, it is a   challenge  for students to understand the principles and concepts   related to computer  organization.&nbsp; The aim is to create instructional course  curriculum modules with more inquiry based   problem-solving activities and hand-on experiences based on Gaming and Virtual  Reality. The  game  theme  instructional  (GTI)  modules  endeavor  to increase   the   students   interest   in   learning   programming concepts.  However,  the  GTI  modules  should  be  usable  and likable  to  include  it  in  a  class  curriculum. We have incorporated a virtual instructor to help  the  users  learn  in  the  modules.  We  have evaluated    the    GTI    modules    using    User    Engagement Scale (UES),  Theory  of  Reasoned  Action  (TRA),  and  Science Motivation   Questionnaire   (SMQII)   to   evaluate   usability, likability, and motivation respectively. The result of evaluation shows  that  the  modules  are  usable,  <a href="../papers/33.pdf">likable</a>,  <a href="../papers/19.pdf">motivational</a>,  and <a href="../papers/VRI-module-Sharma.pdf">engaging</a>. </p>

                  <p align="justify">Virtual reality  instructional modules are widely recognized in academia because they engage  students and motivate them to learn by hands-on experience. For this reason, we  have developed Game Theme based Instructional  (GTI) modules for the teaching  linked list that can provide a better understanding of the concept than  with a traditional instruction approach. We have developed  and evaluated of the GTI gaming module, which adds more inquiry-based  problem-solving activities and hands-on experiences based on gaming and virtual  reality. </p>

The design of the GTI  module is modeled on the constructive approach of learning. The purpose of this  work is to overcome the intellectual crisis by providing a new way of thinking  and learning.&nbsp; We have evaluated the GTI  modules based on the five components of Science Motivation Questionnaire II  (SMQII). The results of the evaluation of GTI modules show that the students  feel self-determined and motivated towards their learning and career.</p>

<p>We have used a proven  four-dimensional framework to assess the perceived learning outcomes and  effectiveness of GTI modules. The first dimension  of the framework focuses on the context where the learning takes place. The second dimension  of the framework, which we have used to identify the effectiveness of GTI  module, focuses upon the attributes of learners. The third dimension  of the framework focuses on pedagogic consideration. The fourth dimension  of the framework emphasizes the mode of representation or tool for use. </p>

                  <p align="justify">This research focuses on the development of a game  theme-based educational module that helps novice students understand  object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, specifically, encapsulation,  polymorphism, and inheritance.&nbsp; This  effort is motivated by the popularity and effectiveness of educational  games.&nbsp; The module was implemented using  Python within Vizard, a virtual reality development toolkit.&nbsp; Three-dimensional (3D) models featured in the  module were created in 3ds Max 2014, a 3D modeling and animation software  application.&nbsp; The results demonstrate  that the module helped students learn OOP concepts and found the module  user-friendly. During the Fall 2014 semester, the module was  evaluated with undergraduate students in a programming course. The students  experimented with the module and took a survey afterwards. Survey data  demonstrates that the module makes a significant educational impact on  students. [<a href="pics/poster-oops.pdf"> Click Here for Poster</a>] A user study found that about 75% of undergraduate students found the OOP module was easy to use and about 92% of them thought that it is effective at helping them learn OOP.</p>

The game shows the action and reaction to each condition, as well as a display of the code for the user to reference. It is created using 3ds Max and Worldviz Vizard. The  duck court background was designed in 3ds max. After the design of the models, the finished product was exported to Vizard as a .ive file. The ducks and beach ball were an inbuilt 3d object from Vizard. <strong>Our  hypothesis is that the use of instructional modules will lead to better student  learning outcomes.</strong> We have conducted user studies for four semester to prove our hypothesis. We  intend to build an interactive module to help students get a better grasp of what  an array structure should be, and how its functions could be implemented. Our  proposed educational module was developed using WorldViz Vizard toolkit. </p>

Eighty-six percent of students reported a good to excellent level of  impact associated with the Duck instructional module compared to 79% for the Array  module. In terms of extent of impact, most students reported a satisfactory  level (i.e., &ldquo;good) at 62% and 58% for the duck and Array instructional modules  respectively. The interpretation of the Likert scale used on these surveys did  not include the rating of &ldquo;Very Good&rdquo;, typically included in a Poor to  Excellent continuum. This analysis therefore defines the rating scale in  relationship to impact as follows: Excellent=Significant, [Very  Good=Substantial], Good=Satisfactory, Fair=Moderate, Poor=Minimal.</p>

The proposed model is designed and  developed using 3Ds Max and Vizard. We have created a 3D grid table as a structured  array, with the help of standby avatar created as an instructor; users would be  able to navigate their way through the game module. First the avatar introduces  the concept of the game and then the user clicks the &ldquo;Enter&rdquo; button to begin  the game. Also, on the left side on the screen, there is a list of object tools  the user would use as data example for the array grid table. </p>
