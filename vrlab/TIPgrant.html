              Bowie State University's (BSU) Targeted Infusion Project entitled -   Increasing Expertise of Minority Students by Development of a Virtual   and Augmented Reality Laboratory for Research and Education at Bowie   State University - will enhance the computer science and mathematics   curriculum and increase research opportunities for undergraduate   students by deploying Virtual and Augmented Reality (VAR) as a research   and educational vehicle to immerse students in research and critical   thinking challenges. The Department of Computer Science enrolls about   250 undergraduate majors, most of whom are African-American. The students will gain experience by using state-of-the-art VR equipment, software and technologies including 3D Wall, Head Mounted Display (HMD) that allows students to visualize complex data in three dimensional (3D) objects, working in 3D space to solve complex spatial problems, and conducting novel research through course work and research experience in the laboratory.<br>
              <br>
The   objectives of this proposal are to: 1) enhance the Virtual Reality   course curriculum with more inquiry based problem-solving activities and   hand-on experiences based on Virtual and Augmented Reality educational   modules; 2) develop the Virtual and Augmented Reality Laboratory for   research and education in the Computer Science Department to provide   undergraduate students with realistic immersive learning environments;   and 3) acquire instrumentation to further develop the teaching and   research infrastructure in VAR laboratories. The project seeks to   prepare computer science majors at BSU to be competitive to enter   graduate programs and the workforce.</p>

With <strong>FLARToolKit</strong>, an AS3 port of the Open Source library <strong>ARToolKit</strong>,   one can detect a marker from an input image and calculate the camera   position in 3D space. Our proposed solution would include putting the markers at key spots in the building, such that the user can use their smart phones to view the 3D representation of the building and exits.
