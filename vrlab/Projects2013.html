                    <p>This project creates an educational game that can test kids&rsquo;  knowledge of geographical trivia, all while having an enjoyable  experience.&nbsp; The game involves having the  user explore their current environment in order to find clues as to where they  need to move next.&nbsp; The idea of a crime  having occurred and the user must track down the suspect and apprehend them,  lends to making the experience more enjoyable for the user.&nbsp; Also, being able to win the game gives kids a  driving factor that will make them want to learn the geographical facts  included in the game, as they all would like to win.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>The  design environments for &ldquo;To Catch a Crook &rdquo; involves immersing the user in  multiple environments with distinct characteristics and objects. In general  each environment includes objects that use proximity sensors to reveal clues to  the user. The user is notified of newly found clues with audio feedback. The  user is also presented with details and instructions of each scene in a dialog  box. In The initial scene the user is placed into a kitchen environment. The  user must interact with different aspects in the kitchen to relieve clues about  the crook. The  final scene leads the user into an action scene involving a confrontation and  chase of the suspected crook.<br>

The building architecture is a simple rectangular geometry textured  with brick, glass, steel, and other materials. The user has total control of  the helicopter and can move in any direction.
