                    <p>The main goal is for players to race and  come in with the best time by racing through the environment and dodging  obstacles. There will be hazardous conditions like debris falling and lava flow.The virtual environment is a volcano that is active. Rocks  line the environment while portions of the map have smoking volcanos. The rock asset&nbsp; is  modular and is used throughout the map. The material was especially constructed  to have glowing cracks in it. It is also used towards the end of the map to  represent a destructible mesh that has rocks fly everywhere.There is also a lava asset constructed from scratch that can  be applied to multiple meshes such as a plane or rock. Characters were used from the engine with already pre-built  animations.
                      Modeled checkpoints are using a particle system. </p>
                    <p><strong>Lighting</strong>:
There is a directional light that serves as the main light  source. The other lights used are checkpoint fire particle system that emits a  light as well as a volcano particle system that has a violent fire at the peaks  of the volcanos. </p>
                    <p><strong>Timers:</strong>Timers are used within the checkpoint blueprints to signify  when the previous checkpoint was passed in order to activate the next  checkpoint. Also they are used for the race itself for lap time and race time. <br>
  <strong>Keyboard  Functionalities:</strong>                      Keyboard functions are how to control the character vehicle  with the arrow keys or WASD.
                      Other keyboard functions are from numbers 0-9 they are  hotkeyed to control npc movement from where they are to a target point at the  end of the map.

Furthermore, we wanted our environment to be so  realistic that once users performed these practical tasks in the virtual simulation, they would  need zero real world experience after using our simulation. Users would just be able to encounter  the real life situation with complete confidence in their  newly acquired skill set gained from the virtual environment.Action events are used in  the environment to animate the tire iron and jack to lift the car,open the trunk,  remove screws, remove the tire, and add a spare tire.</p>
                  <p>The environments consist  of a realistic car model, car part models, computer part models, desks, an auto shop, a classroom, and a lobby where  the simulation initially starts. These parts were used to add realism to the 3D environment. For  example, the user starts the simulation in a 3D lobby where they can go up to a wall where there  are picture frames put into two categories.The two categories  are labeled car care and computer care

The mall has two levels and there are several store in each level.</p>
                The  modeling of the area of the mall consist of an outdoor environment. The mall is  in a small city and is surrounded by buildings. The environment also includes  trees, a road that lead to the mall, street lights, cars, and people. The mall  is an attractive white building very easy to locate. The entry consists of door  which a sensor that take the first person controller to the interior when you  get close to it. The buildings were imported from google sketchup and the  trees, mountains, water and the rest of the environment were modeled in  unity3d.                <p align="justify">.                </p></td>

Your task will be to hunt down and exterminate the  immediate threat before your health reaches 0 in each environment. At the  beginning of each level, your player will be given a full health bar of 100  points to start. But with every shot that you take, it will be a 20% decrease  that will be inflicted on your player&rsquo;s health. You then have to find and  eliminate the threat in each level to avoid being eliminated yourself. We plan on  using an array of locations, in order to place the terrorist throughout the map  effectively. There will be 10 enemies/ terrorist in each environment that has  to be eliminated. We planned on implementing a timer for each level giving you  a reasonable time to find the terrorists. Each level will also have a hidden  health box that will be placed in different locations on the map. </p></td>
