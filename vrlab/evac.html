              caused due to panic. It leads to fatalities as people get trampled

            <p align="justify">Quick evacuation of occupants in a building is 
              very critical to save lives. Training of occupants in a real-time 
              environment is very complex because it is both expensive and dangerous. 
              It is well known that crowd stampede is one of the most disastrous 
              forms of collective behavior that is caused due to panic. It leads 
              to fatalities as people get trampled and crushed as they fall. The 
              evacuation simulation in Virtual Reality demonstrates how people 
              behave in emergency scenarios which they may not be able to experience 
              in a real world. </p>
            <p><strong>Embedded Videos</strong></p>
            <p>Embedded video with a virtual environment can be used to show multiple 
              views for an evacuation visualization task.Embedded video visualizations 
              integrate video and 3D model data to help users understand complex 
              situations. Fig. 5show an agent visualizing the embedded video for 
              exit routes inside the building during evacuation. When evacuating 
              the building, the user relies more on the embedded videos. We plan 
              to further explore several designs from the video processing dimension 
              and the navigation dimension as well in our future work.</p>

            <p>View of an avatar visualizing the embedded video during evacuation</p>
            <p>The goal of our work is to not only to find visualization designs 
              that will prove the effectiveness of using embedded videos in 3D 
              environment, but also to develop general guidelines or theory that 
              will help visualization designers to integrate embedded videos with 
              virtual environment for emergency evacuation. We follow a user based 
              research approach where we involve user at every step. </p>
            <p><strong>Modeling</strong></p>
            <p>The first stage in the creation of application involves modeling 
              the virtual environment. We have modeled the library using 3ds Max 
              and Form Z software&#8217;s.</p>
