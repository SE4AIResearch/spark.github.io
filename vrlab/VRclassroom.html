              Virtual Learning Environment</strong></h1>

            <p><strong>Students: </strong>Wenhao Chen, Roy Brown, and Jeff Ruffin </p>

            <p><em>Status: Current </em></p>

            <p>This project presents a Virtual Reality Classroom environment that is similar to 

              second life. The online virtual classroom is developed so that students can 

              interact with each other and study together. Teachers can also use 

            this mode for delivering lectures in an online virtual environment. The purpose of this project is to use a virtual  reality classroom as a learning tool for education and for students that are  enrolled in online classes. Our research  focuses on how to create a virtual instructor and virtual students and how to  integrate them into the online virtual reality classroom.&nbsp;Our goal is to model  cooperative learning attributes like misbehavior, catching them early behavior,  etc. to produce animation of a virtual environment populated with virtual  avatars. The proposed system is a collection of different   Virtual Classroom model environments created in 3DS Max and exported to  WorldViz Vizard which constitute the base of this application. Animations and interactivity were added to the environment  through a variety of techniques. For instanced Vizard scripts (in Python language) were used to  animate students walking and chatting with each other. Collision detection was  implemented through simple Vizard scripts to keep users from passing through  buildings, other users, and other object in the environment. The aim was to  create an environment that was as close to a real world environment as  possible. In the VR classroom the students will be able to  interact with fellow students and teachers through a server/client feature. Currently, on  the server side the VR classroom environment consists of eight classrooms with  two student lounges with distinct individual textures. On the client side the  user will be able to log into the server as an avatar of his/her choice through  a drop box provided to the user. They will also see the avatars of fellow  students and teachers logged in the environment with a name label popup. In the current system people can navigate the  virtual classroom as a student or as an instructor  through the use of keyboard inputs. We would also like to implement alternative  modes of inputs such as head mounted displays, and data gloves.</p>

            <p><strong>Modeling and VRML</strong></p>

            <p>The earlier version of the multi-user VR classroom was built on top of ABNet. The first stage involved modeling   the building and classrooms using 3ds Max 

              and Form Z software&#8217;s.The second stage in the creation of 

              the application involves converting the 3Ds max file to VRML (Virtual 

              Reality Modeling Language) file. The 3D model of the building modeled 

              in 3D Max was exported to a VRML file.</p>

            <p>The above figure  shows our developed multi-user classroom environment  having the chat functionality implemented using ABNet.&nbsp;We  explored VRMLWorld.net  that is an X3D/VRML chat gateway powered by ABNet. The client side of ABNet uses Javascript on an  HTML page to turn a single-user VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) world  into a Multi-user Virtual World environment. 3D Avatars can interact and use shared events to  provide a virtual experience. This interface  allowed addressing complex  tasks by connecting the VRML web browser plug-in with a Java applet within the  same web page. </p>
