                  <p>Virtual Reality (VR)  training has been used for training and education for many years in military  and medical fields. Pilots and surgeons have both used VR as a training method  in preparation for their respective jobs. Using VR in an evacuation scenario  can be useful in industry as it provides users with accurate scaled models of  their respective workplaces for a more targeted approach. We have used game creation  as a metaphor in creating an experimental setup to study evacuation behavior.</p>

                  <ul>

                    <li>Our hypothesis is that the &ldquo;sense of presence&rdquo; provided by  the multi-user virtual environment will allow running simulations and  conducting evacuation drills without the cost and risk of injury to live actors </li>

                  <p>The  multi user environment was developed  by using different 3D modeling software which include 3DS Max (for 3D models),  <strong>Unity 3D (3D Gaming Platform)</strong>. We present three ways for controlling crowd behavior. First by defining rules for computer simulated agents, second by providing controls to the users to navigate in the VR environment as autonomous agents and the third by providing controls to the users with a keyboard/ joystick along with an immersive VR head set in real time. Our contribution lies in our approach to combine these three approaches of behavior in order to perform virtual evacuation drills and virtual tours in a multi user virtual reality environment for university campus. Results from this study can be used to measure the effectiveness of current safety, security, and evacuation procedure for airplane safety.</p>

                  <p align="justify">Virtual reality experiments with virtual evacuation  drills are necessary to study human behavior under emergency  situations that cannot be evaluated in the real world. The use of collaborative  virtual environments to run virtual evacuation drills for an emergency  evacuation eliminates risk of injury to participants and allows for the testing  of scenarios that could not be tested in real life due to legal issues and  possible health risks to participants. <strong><em>Our contribution lies in our approach to  combine computer simulated agents and user controlled autonomous agents in a  collaborative virtual environment </em></strong>to perform virtual evacuation drills. Results  from this study can be used to measure the effectiveness of current procedures,  protocols, and the effectiveness of training for airline and security personals. <strong>We have  condcted user studies for the proposed pilot environment using  Unity 3D.</strong> The user studies were done for immersive experience using HMD (<a href="http://www.vrealities.com/nvisorsx111.html">nVisor SX111 with Advanced Video Control Unit and 3D wall </a>) and also through the desktop VR environment.

More than 100 respondents participated in this first phase of the user surveys. The majority (74%) of the survey respondents were male. Approximately a quarter were female. The user base for this first phase of the user study can be described as fairly experienced in gaming. The majority (70%) indicated possession of an intermediate to level of gaming experience. Approximately a third of the respondents indicated gaming experience at a novice level. Therefore this user base had an experiential frame of reference to form opinions and judgments about the VR airplane evacuation multi-user environment.</p>

                  <p align="justify"><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
                    These student survey baseline results demonstrate positive student perceptions about the VR environments related to overall quality, user-controlled objects, and realistic quality of navigational experience, animation, and usefulness as an educational/training tool. The Airplane Evacuation environment led at the highest rating level in the areas of being realistic and training for emergency evacuation. Survey respondents were particularly impressed with the realistic nature of the use of smoke and fire in the emergency evacuation VR. However, user panic was not an issue which would seem at odds with producing realistic and &ldquo;real time&rdquo; effects. The panic effects will need further investigation. The continuation of the design process in response to the baseline results along with the inclusion of triangulation of data points in subsequent analyses will be needed to increase the likelihood for realizing this potential.<br>

                  <h2 align="left">Phase 2: Newer Version of A319 Aircraft Evacuation  for virtual drills using immersive (Oculus Rift) multi-user VR Environment</h2>
                  <p>The newer version of aircraft multi user environment is  developed by using Unity 3D (Gaming Platform). The proposed multi user   environment has a cloud connectivity to allow the users to participate in the  evacuation drills. The evacuation participation can be done in two ways: fully  immersive environment and a desktop environment. The fully immersive VR environment  is designed for  oculus rift head mounted display to give the user a  complete immersion. Oculus Rift    allows the user to step into the virtual campus environment and have a  completely immersive view of the environment. For the client/ server communication we used a  plug-in called Photon cloud networking which allows multiple users to participate  in the evacuation and virtual tour of the campus from anywhere in the world. The client/players can then join the room on the  cloud and will be able to join the  VR environment as an  avatar. The desktop environment will have an option to communicate via chat  with the player who enters that room. </p>
