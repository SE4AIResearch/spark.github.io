                    <p>The  goal and objectives of this game were to demonstrate a bowling game within a  virtual environment. Navigations  are controlled using WASD keyboard controls. The  avatars are placed in the room, there are some seatting and some standing. The  designed environment contains 4 lanes, 3 of which will go unused. Our goal was  to make the game that was being played look like a tournament. There are only  pins and a ball for the lane being used. The application can be used by, upon  running, using WASD controls to navigate and spacebar to reset and mouse click  to roll. There were textures such as wood, stone, wallpaper, and carpet. The  application would be used for gaming</p>

They always get everything wrong, and if it wasn't for other people, they would never solve a single case.One common indicator that you may be looking at a Clueless Mystery is the use of the First-Person Peripheral Narrator. For example, Mr. Rich Guy has been killed. Characters A, B and C are established to have motives. Evidence points to characters A, C and also D, who doesn't have a motive but was suspiciously close by at the time of the murder. The real criminal however, is Character Z, who shows up in the last ten minutes as the waiter serving the frustrated police officer his coffee.</p>
