                    <p>The  aim of this project is to create a multiuser virtual city environment similar  to second life using Vizard or Unity 3D as well as other 3D modeling  software.&nbsp; The environment implements a  multiuser interface to allow multiple users to login as a user controlled  vehicle or as a pedestrian and navigate a virtual city. The aim is to create an  environment that can be used as a training and education tool that users can  use to learn how to&nbsp; safely navigate a  busy city.&nbsp; &nbsp;This project &nbsp;can also be used by new drivers to learn about  traffic safety and the various traffic laws.&nbsp;  The virtual city is equipped with everything one would find in a real  world city such as traffic lights, sign, pedestrians, public vehicles, and  other drivers. This environment will allow users to prepare for driving exams &nbsp;as well as teach young children how to safely  navigate a city by doing things such as; cross at a crosswalk and wait for  passing cars.</p>
                    <p>The  Vizard physics library was used to implement steering and control of the user  controlled car.&nbsp; The Library was used to  implement things such as breaking, acceleration, wheel rotation, friction, and  collision effects. Users can control the car through the traditional keyboard  buttons, i.e. the arrow keys or w,a,s,d as well as the mouse. Vizard supports  alternative methods of user interaction such as head mounted displays, Kinect,  wand, and 3D wall. Users  can also trigger some environmental conditions such as a day or night mode via  the keyboard. Users can also change between first person and third person views  based on their preference.<br>

Another objective of the project was to implement this structure on a  multi-user environment. &nbsp;Also, the  location, look and feel of the chat interface was altered on both client and  server side.

The project simulates evacuation of a virtual building observing the perception  and cognition of the animated agents. Simulating how animated agents can learn  from the virtual environment to find the nearest exit in an emergency  evacuation is very important. The animated agent will experience various  emotions such as anger, stress and panic as they try to find their way out of  the building. Agents also react to environmental factors like smoke which can  exacerbate the animated agents speed and direction. This simulation will  provide useful training and education</p>

There  are two separate avatars present upon execution of the client Vizard file.&nbsp; The program allows the user to enter the VRET  as a patient or a therapist.&nbsp; Most  soldiers who are suffering from panic and other neurological disorders are more  likely to feel safe when there in another individual present in the  environment.&nbsp; There is also a chat  functionality that will be implemented that will allow the patient and  therapist to talk and interact within the virtual environment.&nbsp; </p>

By confronting feared situations, thoughts, and emotions, a  person can learn that anxiety and fear will lessen after each exposure session</p>

Simulation of crowd behavior is used in many fields, including  planning, emergency evacuation, training and education and entertainment. The  main idea behind the agent based simulation is to show the interaction and  movement of individual agents. An agent has a set of behaviors and can be  modeled at different levels of anatomy such as user guided or pre-programmed.  Inheriting the adaptive behaviors of human beings in real time is the main inspiration  behind this project. There are different activities are shown in the park  environment. Individual and group behaviors are presented in the project. In  real time people walk on the park pavement that is implemented in the project.  Such type of behavior is called path following. Different groups come together  in case of an emergency. In this case male and female agents are shown  supporting their respective groups. In real life human beings get interested  what their leader says. In this case agents follow the instruction of the  leader and dance. The overall goal is to display crowd behavior simulation to  help real world application like emergency evacuation planning and management.<br>
