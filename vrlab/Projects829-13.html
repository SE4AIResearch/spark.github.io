The goal of this  project is to build upon the previous IFS project creating a multi-user  component that allows for Commander &ndash; Pilot communication. The user will be  capable of flying the aircraft, navigating through the city, locating targets,  destroying targets, and communicating with Commander/Pilot.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of the pilot to  complete his/her mission before the timer reaches zero.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>After  the clients connect to the server, they are immersed into the mission. &nbsp;The client view is equipped with a score  tally, countdown mission timer, missile ready power, and a top-down view of the  battlefield without target locations. The  user is able to navigate by using the following: Up Arrow Key (move forward),  Down Arrow Key (move backward), Left Arrow Key (move left), Right Arrow Key  (move right), Page Up (ascend aircraft), Page Down (descend aircraft), Left  Mouse Button (shoot projectile), also the user&rsquo;s view is linked to the  mouse.&nbsp; In doing so, the user is able to  look around at their surroundings while in the cockpit.&nbsp; </p>

                  <p>The  goal of this project was to create a helicopter training simulation that will  aid in the efforts of treating wildfires. The simulation includes various  scenarios immolating real-world instances. Real-world instances are in place to  develop alternative techniques that may be applied to real life situations. It  is anticipated that the user will gain skills and knowledge in the virtual  environment that they will then be able to apply to the real world due to the  sense of presence and realism a virtual environment can provide. This  application has a dual purpose. The simulation may be used for both training  and educational purposes. The application is to track user efficiency and  decision making strategies. Multiple agents are necessary for this environment  because it will promote communication, collaboration, and will enhance the decision  making process.</p>
