                  <p align="justify">The goal of this project is  combining Genetic  Algorithm (GA) with Neural Networks (NN) to explore how intelligent agents can  look for exits during an evacuation. The agents have the capability to adapt  their behavior in the environment and formulate their response by learning from  the environment. Our approach focuses on modeling individual behavior as well  as group behavior. Individuals constantly adjust their behavior according to  the dynamic factors in the environment. We have developed crowd-modeling and  emergency behavior modeling capability in a goal finding application using C#. This  project examines an intelligent agent-based evacuation that can help plan  emergency evacuations, run numerous event-driven evacuation scenarios, support  research in the areas of human behavior, and model the movement of responders  and security personnel. The adaptive behavior focuses on the individual agents changing their behavior in the environment. The collective behavior of the agent focuses on the crowd-modeling and emergency behavior in the goal finding application. We have developed a new intelligent agent based characteristics such as autonomy, social ability, cooperativeness, and learning ability which define their final behavior when trying to reach a goal. Our contributions  lies in our approach of combining Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Neural Network (NN) to model learning and adaptive behavior of agents in a goal finding application. The proposed application will aid in running multiple evacuation drills for what if scenarios by incorporating agent characteristics.</p>                </td>

            <p>The key aspect of agent based modeling lies in  understanding the mechanism by which autonomous agents interact among  themselves. Our hypothesis is that people with similar  background, race, ethnicity, sex etc are more likely to collaborate together  and exhibit close affinity in emergency than people with varied background. Agents  come from different background with the capability to adapt their behavior  under different environment and formulate their response by learning from the  environment. The agents have characteristics such as:</p>

            <ol>

              <li>Attributes: An agent is a discrete individual and has mass, position,  velocity, force, and speed.</li>

              <li>Emotions: An agent has emotions such as level of panic and stress  attributes. </li>

              <li>Memory: The agents are goal oriented. The agents have a list of goals  that constantly keeps increasing or decreasing depending upon its interaction  with the environment.</li>

              <li>Rules of behavior: An agent has the ability to learn and adapt its  behaviors based on experience in the environment using genetic algorithm and  neural network.</li>

              <li>Decision making capability: An agent is autonomous and can function  independently in its environment while interacting with other agents (dynamic  obstacles) and environment (static obstacles).            </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Our proposed multi agent system models human  behavior. The agent characteristics include attributes, emotions, memory, rules  of behavior and learning, and decision making capabilities. Our proposed multi  agent system also uses MLP (refer fig. below) and consists of variables which provide  a way to keep existing state as it moves thereby relying on the stimulus it  receives from the world.            </p>

            <p>Our proposed C# application can be used to model  situations that are difficult to test in real-life due to safety  considerations. It is able to include agent characteristics and behaviors. The  findings of this modeling are very encouraging as the agents are able to assume  various roles to combine GA and NN on the way to reaching their goals. </p>
<p>We are currently integrating fuzzy logic to  model stress, panic, and the uncertainty of emotions. The findings of this modeling are very encouraging as the agents are  able to assume various roles to utilize fuzzy logic on the way to reaching  their goals.  The fuzzy rules link the parts together while feeding into behavioral  rules.</p>
